# How To Gemini?

The title is phrased as a question, since I don't know how I'm going to use this nifty new Gemini thing.

I already have blogs. I already have a wiki. So, what then? Another blog? That's my first instinct. I like it here in Gemini space already. This could take the place of my TiddlyWiki's "Daily Notes" since those are meant to be read by only those interested (or desperate) to look for it. Content here certainly adds to the necessary effort!
